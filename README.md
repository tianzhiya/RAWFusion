Code of RAWFusion: A Region-Aware Fusion Method for Infrared and Visible Images

## Tips:<br>
Due to file size issues, the training set has been removed from the code and the MSRS dataset can be downloaded here: https://github.com/Linfeng-Tang/MSRS
Place the downloaded training dataset under: train/MSRS path.

The model we trained on the MSRS dataset can be downloaded here:https://drive.google.com/file/d/15079rZT_oi4VqX2BrlqIZJ5HZTTlVd8w/view?usp=sharing

## To Train 
Run "** python train.py**" to train your model.
The training data are selected from the MSRS dataset. 

## To Test
Run "**test.py**" to test the model.
The images generated by the test will be placed under the results/Fusion path.
